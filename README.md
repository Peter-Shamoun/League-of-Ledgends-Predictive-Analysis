## Introduction

League of Legends is one of the most popular video games in the world, boasting a massive player base and a thriving, lucrative esports scene. Despite its popularity, the game is notorious for being difficult to master, largely due to the critical importance of the early game. Often regarded as the make-or-break phase where victories are decided, this stage is central to many strategies and discussions. This analysis seeks to uncover whether the early gameâ€™s importance is a myth perpetuated by the community or a genuine predictor of match outcomes

**Dataset:** The project utilizes a dataset from [source, e.g., Kaggle or other source]. This dataset contains **X rows** and **Y columns** and spans topics such as [brief topics]. 

**Central Question:** What is the relationship between [feature] and [target]? Specifically, does [key hypothesis] hold true?

**Why it Matters:** This analysis can provide actionable insights for [target audience, e.g., policymakers, businesses, researchers]. Understanding this relationship helps address [specific problems or opportunities].

## Data Cleaning and Exploratory Data Analysis

### Cleaning Steps

1. **Missing Value Handling:** Missing values in columns `[X, Y]` were filled using [method, e.g., mean, median, interpolation].
2. **Outlier Removal:** Outliers in `[Column]` were removed using [method, e.g., IQR filtering].
3. **Standardization:** Quantitative variables were standardized to ensure compatibility across scales.
4. **Encoding:** Nominal data in `[Column]` was encoded using one-hot encoding.

### Impact on Analysis

These steps ensured a robust foundation for analysis by minimizing bias and enhancing interpretability.
